# Real-world data science project using Python
Scraping data from laliga. This is my first web scraping project. This project involves scraping data from the La Liga football league website using Python's Beautiful Soup library. The scraped data includes player statistics, team rankings, and other key metrics related to the league. The purpose of the project is to gather data for further analysis and gain insights into player and team performance throughout the season. The project demonstrates the power of web scraping for gathering large amounts of data quickly and efficiently, and provides a useful tool for football enthusiasts and analysts.
The following libraries were used for the project. `pandas` will be used for analysis. `requests` will be used to send requests to the target website. `Beautiful Soup` to scrape the website by parsing the requests.
